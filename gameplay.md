# Cricket Legends: Top Trumps - Gameplay

## Game Overview
Cricket Legends: Top Trumps is a card-based comparison game where players use cricket player cards with various statistics to compete against each other. The goal is to win all cards by strategically selecting the best statistic from your current card.

## Card Structure
Each cricket player card contains:
- Player name and image
- Country and era
- Player type (Batsman, Bowler, All-rounder, Wicketkeeper)
- 6-8 key statistics:
  - Batting Average
  - Strike Rate
  - Total Runs
  - Centuries
  - Wickets Taken
  - Bowling Economy
  - Catch Rate (for fielders/wicketkeepers)
  - Career Longevity (in years)

## Game Setup
1. Each player receives an equal number of cards (typically 15-20 cards)
2. Cards are placed face-down in a stack in front of each player
3. Players can only see the top card of their stack
4. The starting player is randomly determined

## Basic Gameplay
1. The active player selects one statistic from their top card
2. All players reveal the same statistic from their top card
3. The player with the highest value wins the round (for some statistics like Bowling Economy, lower is better)
4. The winner collects all played cards and adds them to the bottom of their stack
5. The winner becomes the active player for the next round
6. Play continues until one player has all the cards

## Special Rules
- **Ties**: In case of a tie for the highest value, those players place their cards in a "war pile" and play another round. The winner of this round collects all cards, including the war pile.
- **Legendary Card Powers**: Special legendary cards have unique abilities that can be activated once per game:
  - **Statistical Boost**: Add 10% to any one statistic for a single round
  - **Peek Ahead**: Look at an opponent's next card
  - **Statistics Swap**: Switch between two statistics after all players have revealed their cards
